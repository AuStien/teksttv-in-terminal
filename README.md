# TiT - TekstTV in Terminal

Displays images of norwegian TextTV retrived from NRK. Since these are images, a terminal with with graphical support is required. Currently the only terminal supported is [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty). [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) is also required.

## TODO:

- Add support for iTerm2
- Add arrow key navigation
